# OOP-Java
Worked on OOP Concepts in Java.

Started from OOP part consisting of classes, constructors and inheritance. After these, I've continued to work on the next part of OOP which includes composition(Inner class and static), encapsulation and polymorphism. Furthermore, I've done parts about abstraction and interfaces as well.
